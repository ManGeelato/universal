The broker acts like a middle man, reviewing your requirements and considering different lenders to find the most suitable loan for you.<\/p>\n<p>Brokers may charge a fee to do the work of finding you a loan whereas others won\u2019t.

If you\u2019re short on time but keen to find a range of possible loans, a broker can do the work on your behalf and search around for the right loan for you.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re able to take the time to compare different loans yourself, you might prefer to apply for a loan directly from a lender. Speaking to them directly can make it easier if you need to communicate any changes or ask questions. It might also save you from paying additional broker fees.<\/p>\n<p>Regardless of if you use a broker or borrow directly from a lender, always ensure you agree to a loan that you can afford to repay throughout the loan term and one which will not place you into financial difficulties and\/or prevent you from meeting your other commitments. Don\u2019t forget to ensure you ask about fees and charges that either the broker or the lender may apply to the loan.[\/vc_column_text][vc_empty_space height=&#8221;20px&#8221;][vc_column_text]<\/p>\n<h4 class=\"vc_custom_heading\"><span style=\"color: #808080;\">If you\u2019re short on time but keen to find a range of possible loans, a broker can do the work on your behalf and search around for the right loan for you.<\/span><\/h4>\n<p>[\/vc_column_text][vc_empty_space height=&#8221;30px&#8221;][\/vc_column_inner][\/vc_row_inner][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row css_animation=&#8221;&#8221; row_type=&#8221;row&#8221; use_row_as_full_screen_section=&#8221;no&#8221; type=&#8221;grid&#8221; angled_section=&#8221;no&#8221; text_align=&#8221;left&#8221; background_image_as_pattern=&#8221;without_pattern&#8221; css=&#8221;.vc_custom_1629196060117{padding-top: 80px !important;padding-bottom: 80px !important;background-color: #efefef !important;}&#8221; z_index=&#8221;&#8221;][vc_column][vc_column_text css=&#8221;.vc_custom_1629195463847{padding-bottom: 30px !important;}&#8221;]<\/p>\n<h2>Terms of Service<\/h2>\n<p>[\/vc_column_text][vc_column_text]<\/p>\n<div class=\"wpb_text_column wpb_content_element \">\n<div class=\"wpb_wrapper\">\n<p>We are not a Lender or Provider and therefore We will not provide finance directly to You; We provide an online loan directory service, We will introduce You to Lenders or Providers of financial services by submitting your online application to the financial service provider of your choice.
