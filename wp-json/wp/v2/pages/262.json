This means that you\u2019re not able to get a loan with financial institutions. We help blacklisted people get personal loans from different financial institutions.<\/p>\n<p>Being blacklisted means you have a bad credit history, it doesn\u2019t mean that you will not be able to get finance from any financial institution. Getting a blacklisted personal loan from a registered credit provider has never been easier! We lend responsibly, treat our customers fairly, and help people to achieve their dreams.<\/p>\n<p>There are no hidden charges. We make all our fees completely clear upfront before you apply.[\/vc_column_text][vc_column_text css=&#8221;.vc_custom_1629196705510{padding-top: 50px !important;padding-bottom: 30px !important;}&#8221;]<\/p>\n<h3>Please note that all our lenders are registered with the NCR.

Maximum APR 38% per annum. Representative example: Loan amount R100 000, terms: 36 months APR (Annual Percentage Rate) 28%, monthly service fee R68.40, monthly repayment R4558.00. The interest rate will depend on the loan amount, loan term and credit profile of applicant.[\/vc_column_text][vc_column_text css=&#8221;.vc_custom_1629196795011{padding-top: 30px !important;padding-bottom: 10px !important;}&#8221;]<strong>RENEWAL POLICY<\/strong>[\/vc_column_text][vc_column_text]If a client is up to date with his loan repayments, they may qualify for a second or third loan depending on the criteria as set by the loan company. The client will have to apply again and the loan provider will look at the clients profile, affordability, etc. The loan provider will then make a decision based on the rules and regulations as set by the NCR.[\/vc_column_text][vc_column_text css=&#8221;.vc_custom_1629196802203{padding-top: 30px !important;padding-bottom: 10px !important;}&#8221;]<strong>IMPLICATIONS OF NON PAYMENTS<\/strong>[\/vc_column_text][vc_column_text]There should only be initial cost if your monthly debit order was unsuccessful as a result of insufficient funds or changing bank accounts without prior notice to the service provider. The service provider will try to contact the client in order to resolve the problem.<\/p>\n<p>If the client can\u2019t be found or the problem can\u2019t be solved, it would be handed over to the internal collections department to see if a solution to the problem can be found. If an agreement can\u2019t be reached, the lender can make use of an external collections company or an attorney.<\/p>\n<p>This will lead to an increase in fees and interest. This will have a big influence on the clients credit score and it will be very difficult to get any more credit from any loan provider.<\/p>\n<p>Monthly premiums for loan repayments will be done by direct debit order collection from the clients bank account. Unsuccessful debit order collections may result in the client being charged a fee by his own bank for the unsuccessful transaction.[\/vc_column_text][vc_column_text css=&#8221;.vc_custom_1629300074528{padding-top: 30px !important;padding-bottom: 10px !important;}&#8221;]<strong>TERMS OF SERVICE<\/strong>[\/vc_column_text][vc_column_text]We are not a Lender or Provider and therefore We will not provide finance directly to You; We provide an online loan directory service, We will introduce You to Lenders or Providers of financial services by submitting your online application to the financial service provider of your choice.
